# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

Code from Clever Programmer YouTube Channel and Ashish Ramachandran // 2020

Demo link: [COVID-19 Tracker](https://covid19-tracker-arama.netlify.app/)!

## About the Project

Pulling from the disease.sh API, this React web app displays the most recent COVID-19 global data in tables, charts and interactive maps with an elegant UI and intuitive UX.

## Running the Project

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Further Steps

Future development will include more information displays with disease.sh data. I would like to look into adding local hospital capacity information for the US if that information is openly available.
